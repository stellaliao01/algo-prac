/*
Say that you are a traveler on a 2D CanvasGradient. You begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner. You may only move down or right.

In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimensions m *n?

Write a function gridTraveler(m,n) that calculates this.

/*
Time complexity: O(2^n+m) || Space complexity: O(n+m)
    -Since we're giving two inputs and we only decrease one input at a given time then overall we're gonna have a n+m overall. Therefore space = O(n+m)
    -For time complexity, since one parent node has two children, we have a 2x2x2 pattern for each level in the tree, that's why time complexity is O(2^(n+m))

    this leads to m * n possible combinations
