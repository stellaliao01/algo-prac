// Here’s the problem we’ll be tackling tomorrow:
// Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.
// Keep in mind the realities and nuances of a parking lot and use that to inform the data structure and any associated methods. Does the parking lot have multiple levels? What “features” does it support? Is it paid? What types of vehicles? What do you need to know about the paking lot capacity? etc.

class parkingLot {
    constructor() {
        this.values = {};
        this.size = 0;
    }
}
